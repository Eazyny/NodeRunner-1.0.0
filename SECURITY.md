## Security Best Practices

### 🔐 1️⃣ Use a Dedicated Wallet

- Use a **delegated wallet** like [delegate.xyz](https://delegate.xyz/) for additional security.

### 📥 2️⃣ Verify the Files You Download
- This software **does not** include the **guardian-cli-win.exe** or the **validation-engine** files.
- You must **manually download** these files from the **official Hytopia repository**:
  - 👉 [HYCHAIN Guardian Node Software Releases](https://github.com/HYCHAIN/guardian-node-software/releases/tag/0.0.1)

### 🔑 3️⃣ Keep Your Private Keys Secure
- **Never share your private key** with anyone.
- Only input private keys inside the **claim.bat** and **start.bat** files if necessary.
- Consider running the app in a **secure environment** such as a **virtual machine**.

### ⚠️ 4️⃣ Be Cautious of Forks and Modified Versions
- Only download this software from the **official GitHub repository**:
